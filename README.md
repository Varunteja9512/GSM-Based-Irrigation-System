# GSM-Based-Irrigation-System
GSM Based Automatic/Manually Operated Irrigation System
The main objective of a GSM based automatic irrigation system using Arduino is automate the irrigation process by using GSM technology to remotely monitor and control the irrigation system. The Arduino will be used to collect data from sensors, control the irrigation system, and send the messages to the user about the systems status. The user will be able to send commands to the system via SMS allowing them to modify the irrigation schedule or turn the system on or off from anywhere in the world. And the project will be concentrated towards the development of the system that works on SMS feature of the mobile phone. The objectives of our system can be divided into two 
categories which are as follows:

General Objectives:  
To develop effective and convenient automatic irrigation system to increase the productivity of crops.

Specific Objectives: 
 To develop system that automatically regulate the moisture of the soil.
 To minimize human labor used in irrigation.
 To provide in convenience in accessing the system from anywhere at any time.
 To save the time of the owner for the large fields.
